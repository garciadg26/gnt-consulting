                                    <h5 class="azul">What is a bonds?</h5>
                                    <p>A surety bond is a contract in which a surety (the surety company) guarantees the fulfillment of an obligation on the part of the surety (the person or company that needs the surety).</p>

                                    <h5 class="azul">What types of bonds are there?</h5>
                                    <p>There are different types of bonds, including performance bonds, down payment bonds, guarantee bonds, and credit bonds.</p>

                                    <h5 class="azul">Who can get a bond?</h5>
                                    <p>Natural and legal persons can obtain a bond, as long as they meet the requirements established by the surety company.</p>

                                    <h5 class="azul">How do you get a bond?</h5>
                                    <p>To obtain a bond, an application must be submitted to a surety company, providing information about the obligation to be secured, as well as the guarantor. The surety company will assess the risk and establish the conditions and the corresponding premium.</p>

                                    <h5 class="azul">What is the cost of a bond?</h5>
                                    <p>The cost of a bond varies depending on the type of obligation to be guaranteed, as well as the risk represented by the secured party. The premium is set based on a rate, which is usually a percentage of the bail amount.</p>

                                    <h5 class="azul">What happens if the obligation guaranteed by the bond is not fulfilled?</h5>
                                    <p>If the surety defaults on the obligation secured by the bond, the surety company will pay the guaranteed amount to the injured party, and then subrogate the rights of the injured party to recover the amount of the bond.</p>

                                    <h5 class="azul">How long does a bond last?</h5>
                                    <p>The duration of a bond depends on the type of obligation to be guaranteed and the conditions established by the surety company. In general, performance bonds usually have a fixed duration, while credit bonds can have an indefinite duration.</p>

                                <h5 class="azul">What is an Insured sum?</h5>
                                <p>An insured sum, also known as a coverage limit or coverage amount, is the maximum amount of money that an insurance policy will pay out for covered losses or damages.

                                <h5 class="azul">What is deductible? </h5>
                                <p>A deductible is a specific amount of money that an insurance policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before their insurance coverage kicks in and begins to pay for the covered expenses.</p>

                                <h5 class="azul">What is a pre-existing condition in health insurance policy?</h5>
                                <p>It is a medical condition/disease that existed before you obtained a health insurance policy, and it is significant, because the insurance companies do not cover such pre-existing conditions within 48 months prior to the first policy or also it can be an exclusion for the contract. </p>

                                <h5 class="azul">Is there any waiting period for claims under the policy?</h5>
                                <p>Yes, when you get a new policy, generally, there will be a 30 days waiting period starting from the policy inception date, during which period any hospitalization charges will not be payable by the insurance companies. However, this is not applicable to any emergency hospitalization occurring due to an accident. </p>

                                <h5 class="azul">Can I transfer my policy from one insurance company to another without losing the renewal benefits? </h5>
                                <p>It is important that you consider that pre-existing disease will not be covered by the new insurance company in case that you have claimed any expenses. </p>

                                <p>If you have dependents or are married, your family can benefit from you having a life insurance policy. Life insurance offers peace of mind by ensuring that your loved ones will be taken care of in the event of your untimely death. </p>

                                <h5 class="azul">What is the max age that I can take out a life insurance policy? </h5>

                                <p>It's important to note that the cost of life insurance generally increases as the insured individual gets older, due to the increased likelihood of health issues and mortality. Additionally, older individuals may be required to undergo a medical examination or provide medical records before being approved for a policy.</p>
